ðŸ‘‹ Hello there,

I am excited to present you the *upgraded website* ðŸŽŠ!

This website site has be migrated from Next 12 with page router to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) 14 with app router, Next is a framework that is built on top of React. "The React Framework
for Production". Next.js brings all the features you need for production such as hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.


So, what's new exactly?

## What's new?

Here's a good overview of the most visible improvements:

- **App Router** - The new App Router. It's allow for co-location.
- **React Server components** - The new website is built with RSC. This means that you can now stream content.
- **Added pages** - The new website has more pages, including a [guestbook](https://alphaolomi.dev/guestbook) page.
- and more...

## Credits

Thanks to the new TailwindUI themes that I used as a base to build the new website.
