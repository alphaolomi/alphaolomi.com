ðŸ‘‹ Hello there,

I am excited to present you the *new website* ðŸŽŠ!

This website site has be migrated from [Gastby](https://www.gatsbyjs.com) to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), Next is a framework that is built on top of React. "The React Framework
for Production". Next.js brings all the features you need for production such as hybrid static & server rendering, TypeScript support, smart bundling, route pre-fetching, and more. No config needed.


So, what's new exactly?

## What's new?

Here's a good overview of the most visible improvements:

- **New design** - The new design is a lot more vibrant and clean. It's also more responsive and mobile friendly.
- **Embeded blog** - The new wesbite has a built-in [blog](#), which is powered by MDX. This means that you can now read the blog posts directly on the website.
- **Added pages** - The new website has more pages, including a page for the [uses](#) and more to be pubished soon.
- **Dark Mode** - Change the color scheme through the header toggle.
- **Improved navigation** - we improved the navigation experience with client-side routing and prefetching.


## Credits

Thanks to the new TailwindUI themes that I used as a base to build the new website.
